## On a Visit through the Forest in the Winter
### Jozef Maselek

You wake up covered in snow. After brushing off some snow from your body, you look around yourself to find that you are stuck in a forest. You do not remember how you ended up in the forest, but you do know that you have to somehow get back to the village where you live. You are well equiped with appropriate clothing and tools for your journey.
